;this file Allfare contains the "transfer" fares for all modes
;
;This is being used for 2025, but is exactly the same as the 2000 fares

; it uses the same fares as in the 2000 base run using the assumption that fares
; keep up with inflation
; $1.00 (01) = $0.70 (90)
; These fares are from MTC's fare matrix with some exceptions.  Most
; notably the fare for mode five was an average of the fares of the 
; biggest transit agencies excluding Muni and BART.  Also, Samtrans
; to SF fares were modified for consistency.  Other minor changes were
; made as well.


; See http://intranet/Modeling/NetworkUpdateChamp43
; This is mostly a translation of the old 2000 fares
; see Y:\networks\Fares\FareEncoding.xls for details
